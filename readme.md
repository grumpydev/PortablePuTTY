## Overview ##

A fork of PuTTY v0.61/portaputty v0.60 - it's PuTTY with settings saved to a .putty directory in the same directory as the PuTTY executable, rather than to the registry.

## Credits ##

I take zero credit for this, all I did was apply some of the changes from portaputty to the latest PuTTY code and built it with VS2010 :-)

Simon Tantham - [PuTTY](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/ "PuTTY") - the original code.

"Potato Salad" - [portaputty](http://code.google.com/p/portaputty/ "portaputty").
